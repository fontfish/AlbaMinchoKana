# Notes & To-Do

These files are predominantly personal notes for keeping track of progress and reminders of what to implement. They may provide some insight as to my work methods, as well as to what I have yet to implement. Please take a look at these before suggesting any changes/alterations, just in case it's already something I have planned.
