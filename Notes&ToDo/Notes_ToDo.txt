Unsure:
Should the 点 on the ン be bigger?


Do:
Remember to make U+1b000 (𛀀) and U+1b001 (𛀁) archaic kana glyphs.
Also make extra punctuation.
The lead-in strokes and flicks on some glyphs are small. Compare all and even out.


Notes:
Don't alter glyphs 015f to 0188 until other glyphs have been completed.
Horizontal setting small kana glyphs should be horizontally centred but moved down by 100. 84.5 - 85% size (84.5% and then broaden).


Post-glyph-creation:
Scale glyphs down slightly for easier spacing? Perhaps alternate version?
	Then copy carefully scaled-down katakana to the AlbaPrintMincho fonts to make photopolymer-suitable version.
Increase contrast (predominantly by thinning hairlines)?
