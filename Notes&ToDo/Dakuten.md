# Dakuten

## Dakuten and Handakuten

*Explanation to be written.*
*dakuten* (゛) and *handakuten* (゜)

## The Issue

One thing I have noticed with great frequency when reading Japanese, especially at small sizes such as in ruby (振り仮名) lettering, is the difficulty in differentiating between these marks. Both are, in very rough terms, a small amount of whitespace in the middle of an enclosing shape. Some typefaces have attempted to overcome this problem by making the *dakuten* bigger or the *handakuten* a thinner ring, but once scaled to sizes where either pixelation, eye strain or ink spread take hold, the difference is often lost.

## A New Approach

In Alba Mincho Kana, I'd like to take another approach, optionally available as an OpenType feature. Rather than simply scaling the mark, I'd like to realign the *dakuten* marks entirely so as to cause no confusion, skewing the placement to a more traditionally calligraphic offset so that the resulting shape is discernible even at very small sizes or in bad printing conditions.
