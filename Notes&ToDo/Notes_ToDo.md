# The To-Do List
## *in order of priority*

## To Do:
* Link all horizontal glyphs to vertical.
* Adjust hiragana shapes and modify glyphs.
* The lead-in strokes and flicks on some glyphs are small. Compare all and even out.
* Create Katakana
* Include U+1b000 (õÄÄ) and U+1b001 (õÄÅ) archaic kana glyphs.
* Make extra punctuation.
* Link all new horizontal glyphs to vertical.

### Vertical forms linked so far

## Once all full-size glyphs have been created:
* Make small kana.
* Make halfwidth glyphs.

* Create Â∞è verstion (all glyphs slightly scaled down).
  * Then copy carefully kana to the AlbaPrintMincho fonts to make photopolymer-suitable version.
  * Increase contrast on AlbaPrintMincho (predominantly by thinning hairlines)?

## Uncertainties:
Should the ÁÇπ on the „É≥ be bigger?

## To Not Do
* Don't use glyps u10FFDE to u10FFED for vertical glyps.

# Notes

## Glyphs so far that need manual direction editing.
„ÄÖ„Åô„ÇÄ
u10FFEF

## Positions
Horizontal setting small kana glyphs should be horizontally centred but moved down by 100. 84.5 - 85% size (84.5% and then broaden).

## Shortcuts:

Ctrl-Shift-_
Ctrl-Shift-D
