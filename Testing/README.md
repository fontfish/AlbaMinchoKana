# Test output

These files are .otf format ouput fonts for testing and review purposes only. Hopefully, they will provide an example of progress as I make changes. I make no guarantee that they work at all.

The file `Py_test_view.py` is a Python file for simple font testing. It relies on the Python3 gi libraries and should be run in a terminal.
